After downloading a zip file u must find the flag.
When you enter the file a .git and flag.txt are found.
Once clicking on the flag only one 2 words appear: flag{redacted}.
In order to retrive the flag, I eneterd the git cli.
Inside the git cli, i entered 'git log' and noticed a log history of a few commits.
I repeatetly entered 'git revert head' until the txt file shocased the correct flag.
The result is 'flag{protect_your_git}'
